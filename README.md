# Prismatic Platinum Pokeemerald Base
*The Pokeemerald base with Prismatic-Platinum changes*

A fork of Pokeemerald that brings players to Sinnoh, with all Pokemon up to gen 8, battle changes including the Fairy type and more.

## Installation

1. Follow this guide to download and install the linux subsystem and get Ubuntu working on your Windows machine: https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald/blob/master/INSTALL.md#windows-1011-wsl1

> **ONLY FOLLOW UP TO THE INSTALLATION STEPS. DO NOT CLONE POKEEMERALD**

2. Instead of cloning the standard pokeemerald, clone our fork:

```
git clone https://github.com/Prismatic-Platinum/prismatic-platinum
```

> Cloning our base should also link your local repo to the remote repo and keep you up to date with our changes.

3. Make sure you are in the root directory and can see our prismatic-platinum file (`ls` to see files in the current directory). Then, run the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/pret/agbcc
cd agbcc
./build.sh
./install.sh ../prismatic-platinum
```

## VSCode and Extensions

It is recommended to use VSCode to edit and add new files to our decomp, as well as Git. This will create a link between your own and the remote directory, which will let you push your changes for everyone to see using the Git tab on your VSCode. It will also let you pull changes that others have made, keeping us all up to date on development.

- [**VSCode**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - An open source IDE for editing in multiple languages.
- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - An engine for syncing your directory with ours.
- [**Portscript**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=karathan.poryscript) - An extension for VSCode for decomp file compatibility.

## Additional tools

Tools for editing the decomp in order to add additional features, make changes to the world, impliment story and much more.

- [**Porymap**](https://github.com/huderlem/porymap) - A map editor for the Pokémon generation 3 decompilation projects (pokeruby, pokeemerald, and pokefirered).
    - And a [**Guide**](https://huderlem.github.io/porymap/)
- [**Tilemap-Studio**](https://github.com/Rangi42/tilemap-studio) - A tilemap editor for Game Boy, GBC, GBA, NDS, SNES, Genesis, or TG16 projects.
- [**Poryscript**](https://github.com/huderlem/poryscript) - Poryscript is a higher-level scripting language that compiles into the scripting language used in pokeemerald.
    - Install by following [these steps](https://github.com/huderlem/poryscript#local-development). Ensuring you [install go](http://golang.org/) and are cloning the repo into the directory which contains your 'Pokeemerald' folder. ***Do not clone into the Pokeemerald folder***

# Built with Pokeemerald Expansion

## What is pokeemerald-expansion?

pokeemerald-expansion is a decomp hack base project based off pret's [pokeemerald](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) decompilation project. It's recommended that any new projects that plan on using it, to clone this repository instead of pret's vanilla repository, as we regurlarly incorporate pret's documentation changes. This is ***NOT*** a standalone romhack, and as such, most features will be unavailable and/or unbalanced if played as is.

If you use pokeemerald-expansion in your hack, please add RHH (Rom Hacking Hideout) to your credits list. Optionally, you can list the version used, so it can help players know what features to expect.
You can phrase it as the following:
```
Based off RHH's pokeemerald-expansion v1.7.3 https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/
```

### [Documentation on features can be found here](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/wiki)

## If I already have a project based on regular pokeemerald, can I use pokeemerald-expansion?
Yes! Keep in mind that we keep up with pret's documentation of pokeemerald, which means that if your project a bit old, you might get merge conflicts that you need to solve manually.
- If you haven't set up a remote, run the command `git remote add RHH https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion`.
- Once you have your remote set up, run the command `git pull RHH master`.

With this, you'll get the latest version of pokeemerald-expansion, plus a couple of bugfixes that haven't been released into the next patch version :)

## **How do I update my version of pokeemerald-expansion?**
- If you haven't set up a remote, run the command `git remote add RHH https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion`.
- Once you have your remote set up, run the command `git pull RHH expansion/1.8.0`.
